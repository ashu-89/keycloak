From bin folder, execut the following command to start keycloak on a port other than default 8080.
\kc.bat start-dev --http-port=8180
Don't know why GitHub tries to be oversmart and display's above command incorrectly till we don't enter edit mode.
the command is:
"kc.bat start-dev --http-port=8180" .. no quotes obvio, but Github makes doube hyphens as single hyphen, lol.
